        <h3>🍵 Drinks</h3>
        <p>The café brags a fine range of drinks in the menu. It includes various coffees, lattes, mocha lattes, and they also serve non-coffee drinks. Throughout our visit, we ordered their Matcha Latte, Strawberry Matcha and their newly added drink, Seasalt Matcha. Their drinks were rich, perfectly sweetened, they also have a distinct striking good balance. Their Matcha Lattes, whether it’s their strawberry, or sea salt variations, they feature a smooth, creamy base with the earthy, slightly bitter notes of matcha; their Strawberry Matcha adds a refreshing sweetness and tang from strawberries, while their Seasalt Matcha introduces a savory twist with a hint of salt, enhancing the matcha's umami profile.</p>
        <h3>🍪 Food</h3>
        <p>In terms of food, they serve cookies and brownies. Their cookies offers diverse tastes. Their Chocolate Chip Cookie is known for its sweet, buttery flavor with hints of vanilla and rich chocolate chips that add a slightly bitter and melty contrast, creating a comforting experience. In contrast, a Red Velvet Cream Cheese Cookie combines a soft, mildly cocoa-flavored base with a tangy, creamy filling, resulting in a decadent and satisfying treat.</p>

        <p>⚡The service speed at the café is very commendable. The drinks arrived within just 5 minutes, which was impressively quick and allowed their customers to start enjoying their order almost immediately. In contrast, you can just buy the cookies since they are already made. The efficient service adds to the overall positive experience, ensuring that customers aren’t left waiting too long. </p>
